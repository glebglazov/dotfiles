# Setup to push to obsidian backup vault from automations GitHub profile

# Adding these two includeIf with couple of things to review next time I'll need to tweak that setup
# 1. Directive includeIf works only with "/" at the end
# 2. There are two paths added, cause "Dev" folder is a symlink of "private/Dev", so I need to include both paths for that to work in all cases
